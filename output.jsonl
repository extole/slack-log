{"prompt": "<@UA923RBEW> could I get a solutions engineer to join a discovery call with Ashley Furniture US? They want to scope out our product sharing capabilities and see if we can support a sharable card feature. A customer would build out their cart then they can share their cart with another user. Might be similar use case to the Athleta <https://extole.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SERVICES/pages/2625503379/Athleta+Closet+Builder+Customization+Spec|closet builder customization>.", "completion": "<@U03JKC10X5M> would Friday at 11:00 AM CST work for you?"}
{"prompt": "could anyone describe to me how we do friend capture on a meridian link account opening form?", "completion": "Most clients that use Meridian Link use Extole to capture the friends email on sign up and then send us the account openings by file or API. If a client wants to bi-pass email capture through Extole FLE they need to do so by tag which is not generally an option with Meridian Link"}
{"prompt": "could anyone describe to me how we do friend capture on a meridian link account opening form?", "completion": "To add to that, more often than not we choose to do the FLEM vs. overlay. In the past, the FLE overlay was sometimes suppressed (thus we missed attribution for some referrals)"}
{"prompt": "could anyone describe to me how we do friend capture on a meridian link account opening form?", "completion": "yep! That would be the friend landing experience microsite (extole hosted email capture page) vs. the friend landing \"pop up\" that is powered by a javascript tag."}
{"prompt": "could anyone describe to me how we do friend capture on a meridian link account opening form?", "completion": "We call it a \"pop up\" but that sounds more spammy, so I've been trying to call it the share experience or friend landing overlay"}
